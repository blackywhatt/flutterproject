Savings Goal Tracker

Savings Goal Tracker is a simple Flutter utility app that helps users calculate how many weeks they need to reach their savings goal. Users can enter their target amount, weekly or monthly savings, and starting balance, then the app calculates the total weeks required to achieve their goal.

Inputs → Process → Output 

Inputs: 
- Target Amount (RM), 
- Saving Amount, 
- Starting Balance (RM), 
- Saving Frequency (Dropdown: Per Week / Per Month) 

Process: 

- Validate inputs using double.tryParse(...) ?? 0 
- Convert saving amount to weekly rate if 'Per Month' is selected
- Compute remaining = target - starting and weeks = remaining / saving_per_week 
- Update the result using setState() 

Output: 

A message showing the number of weeks needed to reach the savings goal.

Widgets Used:

- Scaffold, AppBar - App structure and title
- Text, TextField -  Display and receive user input 
- DropdownButton - Select saving frequency
- ElevatedButton - Process the calculation
- Container - Display result area with decoration 
- Row, Column, Padding, SizedBox - Layout arrangement
- SingleChildScrollView -  Allows scrolling on smaller screens 

Validation Approach:

- All numeric inputs are safely parsed using double.tryParse(value) ?? 0. 
- Displays a friendly inline message if inputs are invalid or empty. 
- Prevents crashes by handling all invalid states through conditional checks. 
- Uses setState() to update the UI dynamically.
